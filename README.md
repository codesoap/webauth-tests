This is a quick and dirty implementation of web authentication using
bcrypt, JWT and cookies. I did this as a learning exercise.

If you ever wondered how some simple web authentication could be set up
you might find the code interesting.

The code is absolutely unsafe for production use and near to no error
handling is implemented.
